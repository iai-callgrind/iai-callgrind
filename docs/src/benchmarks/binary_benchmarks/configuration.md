# Configuration

The configuration of binary benchmarks works the same way as in library
benchmarks with the name changing from `LibraryBenchmarkConfig` to
`BinaryBenchmarkConfig`. Please see
[there](../library_benchmarks/configuration.md) for the basics. However, Binary
benchmarks have some additional configuration possibilities:

* [Sandbox](./configuration/sandbox.md)
* [Configure the exit code of the Command](./configuration/exit_code.md).
